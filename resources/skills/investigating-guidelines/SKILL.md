# Investigating Guidelines

Guidelines for root cause analysis. Skip for obvious issues with clear fixes.

## Key Principles

1. **Root cause over symptoms** - Don't fix what you see; find why it happens. A fix upstream often eliminates multiple issues.

2. **Verify with actual data** - Check current state (run commands, read logs/configs) before proposing solutions. Don't reason from assumptions.

3. **Research before inventing** - For common problems, search how others solved it. Validate approaches against proven solutions.
