# Learning Guidelines

Capture reusable knowledge when you discover something non-obvious. Skip if trivial or already documented.

## Process

1. **Learn**: identify the *actual* lesson, not the surface-level fix
2. **Generalize**: extract the principle, don't transcribe the specific correction
3. **Scope**: Matter where? One spot → comment. Project → docs. Everywhere → skill.
4. **Draft → review → simplify**: write it, re-read for accuracy, cut the fluff

## Verify

- [ ] Captures the principle, not the specific fix
- [ ] Narrowest scope that covers future cases
